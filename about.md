Hi, my name is Santiago Martinez (AKA S4dum4). I am an eternal student, living in Manizales, Colombia. In this blog I will document everything that I learned in depth in my computer security journey. If you want to know more about what I learn every day, follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/s4dum4).

If you have any questions about anything, just send me a message.
